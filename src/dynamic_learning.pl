/** <module> Predicates for dynamic learning with predicate invention.

Dynamic learning differs to "static" learning (implemented by
learn/[1,2,5]) in that, as soon as a new generalising metasubstitution
is found (and given that the metasubstitution satisfies any constraints)
it is applied to its corresponding metarule and written to the dynamic
database so it can be re-used by further Top program construction steps.

This allows the construction of sets of metasubstitutions that, applied
to their metarules, result in sets of connected clauses. Two clauses, C
and D, are connected, iff one or more body literals of C unify with the
head literal of D.

In order to create sets of connected clauses, dynamic learning performs
predicate invention. When proving a body literal of a metarule during
the generalisation step of Top program construction fails, a new Top
program is constructed, recursively, with that literal as the only
positive example and with a new, invented predicate symbol. If a
non-empty Top program is constructed this way, it is taken as a
definition of the invented predicate.

An invented predicate's symbol is then used in a subsequently
constructed clause, to form a connected pair of clauses. More than two
clauses can be connected in this way. The ability to connect clauses
allows learning hypotheses that could otherwise only be learned by
specifying long metarules, with a potentially large number of body
literals.

Besides making heavy use of the dynamic database, dynamic learning
predicates also perform destructive updates of a counter used to keep
track of the number of invented predicates and also to construct their
names by indexing the atom '$' with the current highest invented
predicate index + 1.

Dynamic learning essentially updates the background knowledge by adding
each clause in the Top program (of the original target or an invented
predicate) to the dynamic database as soon as it is constructed. Because
of this, it relies very strongly on the order in which examples are
given. For example, given the first ordering of examples, below, 'S'/2
is learnable with dynamic learning, but given the second ordering, it is
not:

==
% 'S'([a,b],[]) must be found first before all other examples otherwise
% learning 'S'/2 with dynamic learning will fail
positive_example('S'/2,E):-
	member(E, ['S'([a,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,a,b,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,a,a,b,b,b],[])
		  ]).

?- learn_dynamic('S'/2).
'$1'(A,B):-'S'(A,C),'B'(C,B).
'S'(A,B):-'A'(A,C),'$1'(C,B).
'S'(A,B):-'A'(A,C),'B'(C,B).
true.

% This ordering makes 'S'/2 impossible to learn precisely with dynamic
% learning:

	member(E, ['S'([a,a,b,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,b],[])
		  ,'S'([a,a,a,b,b,b],[])
		  ]).

%!	table_encapsulated(+Targets) is det.
%
%	Prepare one or more encapsulated learning Targets for tabling.
%
%	Targets is a list of predicate indicators, F/A, the predicate
%	symbols and arities of a list of target predicates.
%	table_encapsulated/1 prepares for tabling each predicate m/N,
%	where N is A+1 for each target predicate in Targets. m/N is the
%	predicate encapsulating each Target (though not necessarily
%	_only_ target predicates).
%
%	Motivation
%	----------
%
%	Tabling the predicates encapsulating each learning target is a
%	convenient way to avoid entering an infinite recursion when a
%	left-recursive clause of a target predicate is added to the
%	background knowledge. Because dynamic learning adds to the
%	dynamic database clauses of the Top program learned in a
%	previous iteration, so that they may be called in subsequent
%	iterations, if a left-recursive clause is added to the dynamic
%	database the learning procedure can enter an infinite recursion.
%	Tabling, a.k.a. SLG resolution, avoids this and guarantees
%	termination by precomputing the result of recursive calls and
%	storing them in a table, so that execution does not have to
%	descend infinitely, like it does with ordinary SLDNF resolution.
%
%	@tbd Tabling is a new feature in Swi-Prolog and it may change
%	substantially in the future. For the time being, this predicate
%	works as intended. If tabling changes, this may have to change
%	also.
%
%	@tbd Encapsulation predicates are probably best defined as
%	incremental and declared dynamic and incremental, since multiple
%	clauses of them may be added to the program database during
%	learning. Declaring predicates as incremental tells the tabling
%	mechanism to update a table whenever a tabled predicate's
%	definition changes. This may not be a perfect solution.
%
%	@tbd The predicates in the closure of the BK may need to be
%	tabled also, even though they are not actually to be modified.
%	This would relax the requirement on the BK that it must
%	terminate.

%!	top_program_dynamic(+Counter,+Positive,+Negative,Metarules)
%!	is det.
%
%	Dynamically create the Top program for a MIL problem.
%
%	This predicate combines the generalisation and specialisation
%	step that are implemented by separate predicates in "static"
%	learning, in generalise/3 and specialise/3 in louise.pl.
%
%	top_program_dynamic/4 first attempts to generalise a positive
%	example using a metarule. The generalision attempt binds the
%	head of the metarule to the example and then proves each of the
%	body literals of the metarule, in turn, by resolution with the
%	positive examples and background knowledge.
%
%	If the proof of each body literal is successful, the resulting
%	metasubstitution is tested against constraints.
%
%	If the constraint test passes, the metasubstitution is
%	specialised against the negative examples. To specialise a
%	metasubstitution, first a negative example is bound to the head
%	of the metasubstitution, then its body literals are proven by
%	resolution against the positive examples and background
%	knowledge. If any such proof succeeds, which means that the
%	metasubstitution entails a negative example, the
%	metasubstitution is discarded.
%
%	During the generalisation step, if proof of a literal fails,
%	predicate invention is performed. This happens during a call to
%	prove_body_litearls_/3. The literal that cannot be proven given
%	the positive examples and background knowledge is given a new
%	predicate symbol, of the form '$n' where n is an integer from 1
%	to the maximum number of invented predicates set in the
%	configuration option max_invented/1. Then, a new Top program is
%	constructed with that literal as the only positive example, no
%	negative examples and the same background knowledge and
%	metarules as the original Top program construction step.
%
%	When a Top program construction step, i.e. the combination of
%	generalisation, specialisation and a constraint test, is
%	completed successfully, the resulting metasubstitution is first
%	applied to its corresponding metarule and written to the dynamic
%	database. Applying the metasubstitution to a metarule results
%	in a definite clause. The clause is encapsulated and so it
%	becomes immediately available to the next Top program
%	construction step, as a background predicate.
%
%	Metasubstitutions are later collected from the dynamic database
%	with a call to collect_clauses/3 and the dynamic database
%	cleaned of all encapsulated clauses.

%	@tbd This sorts the collected clauses at the end usig predsort/2

%	----------
%
%	The purpose of this predicate is to make programs learned with

%
%	Predicates invented by Louise with dynamic learning have
%	automatically assigned symbols such as '$1', '$2' etc, so that

%	predicate can sometimes make a program _more_ comprehensible by
%	reducing its size, in general it's safe to assume that a program
%	without invented predicates will be at least as comprehensible
%	as a program of the same size and _with_ invented predicates.
%
%	The 'S'/2 example above is such a case. In the "Invented" form
%	of the program, it's hard to say what the predicate '$1'/2 is
%	meant to represent. Unfolding the program we obtain a version
%	without '$1'/2 that is closer to (if not identical with) a
%	proram that a human programmer would have written (indeed, the
%	proram is a classic definition of a grammar for the anbn
%	language).
%
%	Unfolding
%	---------
%
%	Unfolding is the dual of folding, a program transformation that,
%	in logic programs, replaces goals in the bodies of clauses with
%	the body literals of the "called" clauses.
%
%	Procedurally, unfolding resolves the head literal of a clause C,
%	with a body literal, L, of another clause, D, producing a new
%	clause with the head literal of C and the body literals of C and
%	D, except for L.
%
%	For example, suppose C = p:- q, r, D = q:- s, t and L = q. Then,
%	unfolding D onto L in C would result in a new clause, E = p:-
%	s,t,r.
%
%	As the 'S'/2 example in the prvious section demonstrates, if L
%	is the literal of an invented predicate in a clause of a target
%	predicate, unfolding will produce a new clause without any
%	literals of invented predicates.
%
%	Restricted unfolding
%	--------------------
%
%	Unlike general unfolding this predicate does not
%	indiscriminately generate all resolvents of the clauses of
%	target predicates and invented predicates. Instead, only those
%	resolvents that entail at least one positive example with
%	respect to background knowledge are constructed, i.e. the
%	process is driven by the positive examples.
%
%	For this reason, unfold_invented _cannot be used_ unless the
%	positive examples and the background knowledge for a MIL problem
%	from which Program was learned are in the dynamic database.
%
%	In other words, it is not possible to use unfold_invented/3 as a
%	stand-alone predicate. It _must_ be used as part of learning
%	with a dynamic learning predicate.
%
%	Limitations
%	-----------
%
%	This predicate does not take into account the negative examples
%	and instead generates the set of all resolvents of clauses in
%	Program that entail at least one positive example. As a result,
%	Unfolded _may_ include any number of clauses that entail some
%	negative examples. Whether this is really possible is to be
%	determined.
%
%	@tbd Currently, unfold_clauses/5 (auxiliary to this predicate
%	that does most of the actual unfolding) returns clauses ground
%	to constants obtained during a refutation of a positive example.
%	This is actually not that bad, because it incidentally forces
%	unfold_clauses/3 to succeed or fail exactly once for each
%	resolvent of a clause of a target predicate (whereas otherwise
%	it would potentially backtrack over all positive examples).
%	Unfortunately, this also requires the unfolded program to be
%	"lifted" to variabilise its constants. Since Program is
%	encapsulated, lifting it will variabilise the predicate symbols
%	in literals, which will result in a nonsensical program with
%	literals like m(P,X,Y,Z) where P should be a predicate symbol,
%	rather than a variable. To avoid this, we utilise a predicate
%	encapsulated_signature/2 to collect all constants in the
%	encapsulated input Program, which, since Program is
%	encapsulated, includes not only predicate symbols but also
%	constants of the learned theory. The whole process is a little
%	fiddly and not exactly the most efficient thing in the world,
%	but the alternative is even fiddlier and includes passing around
%	metasubstitutions and instantiating their existentially
%	quantified variables. While this is doable, honestly, I don't
%	have the heart to do it. Too much work. So unfolding a program
%	will be slow if we have too many clauses with too many damn
%	literals. OK.
